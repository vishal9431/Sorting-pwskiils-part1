// Which of the following(s) is/are true about bubble sort:
// It is stable sort
// It has a worst case space complexity of O(n)
// It involves swapping of adjacent elements
// After each iteration, the greatest element is placed at the end of the array.
// ans is  It is a stable sort, It has worst time complexity of o(n^2), It involve swapping of adjacent elements which led to greatest element placed at end of every loop
